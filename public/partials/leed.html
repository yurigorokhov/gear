    <h1>LEED</h1>
    <p>During the summer of 2007 GEAR Management Group (GMG) decided to join the green movement, and began the process of building more environmentally friendly retail stores. This practice is structured by the LEED rating system put in place by the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit organization committed to expanding sustainable building practices. LEED stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, and is a ratings system that encourages green building and development through the creation and implementation of accepted tools and performance criteria.</p>
    <p>Several GMG Construction Managers have successfully passed the Accreditation Exam to become qualified as LEED Professionals. This means that they have shown the understanding of the green building practices and principle and the LEED ratings systems. Their abilities will allow them to implement and execute plans for future environmentally structured stores.</p>
    <p>After the completion of our first wave of LEED stores, GMG was awarded both gold and silver awards, for successfully meeting all the USGBC requirements for green building. The notification of the multiple awards has far exceeded GEAR Management Groupâ€™s expectations for our initial efforts at the LEED certification process. This news has encouraged the team to continue to improve upon themselves in green technology and multiple employees are currently enrolled in upcoming education seminars. We feel that the more educated we are as a whole, the better we will be able to assist our current and future clients in their environmental endeavors.</p>
