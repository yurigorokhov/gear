    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p>GEAR Management's methodology for successfully completing retail pipeline programs from Feasibility through Entitlement and Project Management, begins with an extensive study of the client's needs, scope of work, expectations, style and program complexity.&nbsp; This data is cross referenced with our internal team's profiles, background and experience.&nbsp; The most competent appropriate professionals are 'hand selected'&nbsp;based on their individual&nbsp;skill sets&nbsp;and the relevance of their skill sets to your scope of&nbsp;work.</p>
    <p>Once the&nbsp;team is&nbsp;identified, we then&nbsp;partner with you to immerse ourselves in further learning about you; preferred systems, processes, protocol, methods of communication, etc.&nbsp; We identify&nbsp;any opportunities and develop any additional tools and templates&nbsp;which we will require to&nbsp;successfully perform our assigned responsibilities.&nbsp; We ensure we understand who our internal day to day contact&nbsp;is and what their individual expectations are, this includes setting protocol and parameters for the relationship go-forward.&nbsp; Our team members familiarize themselves with all external and internal business partners and ensure we fully understand their role in the overall store delivery process.&nbsp; Our selected Project Managers are&nbsp;then fully prepared to take on all aspects&nbsp;of&nbsp;the scope of work and are held accountable for successfully completing and clearly communicating on all issues.</p>
    <p>GEAR&nbsp;Management&nbsp;Group, LLC was founded on the principles of Pride, Integrity and Ownership.&nbsp; Our teams display these traits on every project we touch.&nbsp; We understand the importance of ownership, responsibility, partnership and accountability&nbsp;on every phase of the project. &nbsp;It is our standard operation method to become entrenched in your culture and become a seamless part of the store delivery team.&nbsp; We own the project timeline and deliver to it.&nbsp; We ensure all business partners are aligned and performing to your expectations and requirements.&nbsp; We represent you in a professional manner, always with integrity in all matters and guard your interests and finances as if they are our own.</p>
    <p>Once a project is executed we pride ourselves on complete, clean closeouts with full communication and documentation.&nbsp; Our job is done when the project is closed out per your specified criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the entire process we encourage and require open communication with our clients&nbsp;to discuss changes in expectations and&nbsp;strategy, as well as performance evaluations. &nbsp;This enables us to continually tailor or 'course correct' as&nbsp;your needs&nbsp;evolve.</p>
